## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production code (protected)
- `dev` - Development integration  
- `feature/*` - New features
- `fix/*` - Bug fixes

### Getting Started
1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/description`
3. Make your changes and commit: `git commit -m "feat: description"`
4. Push and create PR to `dev` branch

### Code Review
- All PRs require review
- Tests must pass
- Documentation updated
